# Music-Lyrics-MyMisery
# A song i wrote about survival after the bombs fell.


I breathe ash in my lungs again,
The world outside is burned and thin.
The sun’s a ghost behind the grey,
I walk these ruins anyway.

If I don’t move, I die alone,
If I do, the Zone will break my bones.
But I keep walking through the haze,
’Cause dying here seems worse than pain.

Agony, enemy, ending me, my MISERY!
my MISERY!
Agony, enemy, ending me, my MISERY!

Cold walls whisper secrets to me,
Down here the bunker never sleeps.
The lights flicker when something breathes,
Above the earth breaks, below it creeps.

Rats in the pipes, ghosts in my head,
I count the hours ’til I’m dead.
But morning comes — at least they say,
Out there, dawn looks like decay.

Agony, enemy, ending me, my MISERY!
my MISERY!
Agony, enemy, ending me, my MISERY!

This last candle on the table,
Fights the dark as best it’s able.
Every flame reminds me of a friend,
Every friend reminds me of the end.

We had dreams back before the blast,
Now all we dream is “let today pass.”
But I’ll write their names in soot and bone,
So the world remembers — I’m not alone.

Agony, enemy, ending me, my MISERY!
my MISERY!
Agony, enemy, ending me, my MISERY!

I saw a shape move in the fog today,
It wasn’t man, but it walked my way.
Eyes like coals and a broken spine,
It remembered hunger — I remembered mine.

Blood on my boots and fear in my throat,
This world’s a graveyard wearing a coat.
If I die tonight, carve it in stone:
I walked the lands where the mutants roam.

Agony, enemy, ending me, my MISERY!
my MISERY!
Agony, enemy, ending me, my MISERY!
